## Features

- Visualizes Dijkstra's algorithm in real-time
- Ability to block cells to simulate obstacles
- Interactive grid where users can set the start and end points
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Fast and efficient performance using Vite

## Demo

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/path-visualizer.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```bash
    cd path-visualizer
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the application**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Setting Start and End Points**
   - Click on a cell to set the start point.
   - Click on another cell to set the end point.

2. **Blocking Cells**
   - Click on any cell to toggle its blocked state. Blocked cells cannot be traversed by the algorithm.

3. **Visualizing the Algorithm**
   - Click the "Start" button to begin the visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Standard web technologies
